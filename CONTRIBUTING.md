# Contributing to dd-opentracing-cpp

As an open source project we welcome contributions of many forms, but due to the experimental beta nature of this repository you should reach out before starting work on any major code changes. This will ensure we avoid duplicating work and help ensure your code can be merged despite our rapidly changing base. If you would like support for a use-case that is not listed, please [contact support][1] to make a request.
